# IsingModel_Julia
Small Julia+MC test on the Ising model. Includes a IsingMC.jl 
with all the necessary routines and examples on how to use them.
The main purpose of this code is to get familiar with the 
Monte-Carlo method and Julia.

## Known limitations

- Only the energy is calculated, no other observable
- no parallelization
